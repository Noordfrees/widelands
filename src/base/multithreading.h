 * This struct handles the global mutex. The logic and drawing code are executed in
 * parallel, but some functions assume that the game state doesn't change while they
 * are executing. Create a MutexLock when entering such a critical section. This will
 * suspend the current thread until the lock is available, then claim the lock for
 * this thread. You HAVE TO ensure the MutexLock's deletion as soon as you leave the
 * section, otherwise other threads that need the lock will not be able to resume!
 * In order to prevent the threads suspending each other for too long, claim the
 * lock only for the shortest pieces of code possible.
 * The intended usage is:
 *     non_critical_code();
 *     {
 *         MutexLock m;
 *         critical_code();
 *     }
 *     non_critical_code();
 * Note that mutexes are recursive, that is, a thread may lock a mutex several times,
 * but needs to free it the same number of times before another thread can claim it.
 * If the `optional` parameter is `true`, the constructor returns immediately without
 * locking the mutex if it is already being held by another thread. In this case,
 * `is_valid()` will return `false`.
 * Some good explanations here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14888027/mutex-lock-threads
